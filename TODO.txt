CI:
- LTO
- Why's -stdlib=libc++ needed for std::expected? https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/62801

Tooling:
- clang-tidy
- coverage

Chess:
- Node: try aligning to cache line size
- walk: focus on captures if the singular checker is a knight or pawn (no need to visit quiet moves).
- Node: save en passant victim instead of target
